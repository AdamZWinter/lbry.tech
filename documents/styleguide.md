### CSS
- Styles should never override
- IDs do not belong in stylesheets
- Nesting is should be a maximum of three levels deep
- BEM is your friend
- Nested includes should be at the top of rules
- CSS parameters in alphabetical order, except for presentation styles



### JS
- No trailing commas
- Semicolons are there to protect you from yourself
- Use strict comparing (`!==` / `===`), as false-y values are evil
