# Introduction to LBRY protocol

## Mission

What if anyone in the world could publish a piece of digital content, anyone else in the world could access it, for free or for payment, and that entire system worked end-to-end without any centralized authority or point of control?

That's the idea behind LBRY. To create a market for accessing and publishing information<sup>1</sup> that is global<sup>2</sup>, decentralized<sup>3</sup>, robust<sup>4</sup>, optimal<sup>5</sup> and complete<sup>6</sup>.

That's a fancy sentence, so here's a plainer one: we just thought it'd be really damn cool if there was a system that stored as much of the world's information as possible, but was owned and controlled by no one.

<sup>1</sup>In the information theoric sense, i.e. any data. LBRY facilitates distribution of all data, whether it be a video or a spreadsheet.

<sup>2</sup>Accessible anywhere in the world on any internet-connected device.

<sup>3</sup>Not controlled by any one person, party or authority.

<sup>4</sup>Resistant to censorship or attempts to control; impervious to attacks or disruptions. 

<sup>5</sup>In the Pareto sense, with regards to the production and distribution of information (i.e. digital information is both created and distributed in a way that could not be any more efficient from the perspectives of information producers and consumers).

<sup>6</sup>The most complete collection of worldâ€™s books, films, art, games, etc. should be available via LBRY.
